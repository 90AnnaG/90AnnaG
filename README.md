I've been learning basic programming languages for web development in my spare time for about a year. I can create a website using HTML and CSS including SASS and RWD, I use the BEM methodology, I also know the basics of JavaScript, jQuery and Git. I want to expand my knowledge of TypeScript, React.js library and other technologies related to the frontend. I can also operate on Windows, Linux and MacOS at the basic / intermediate level.

 ## So far, I have made a few simple projects using pure JavaScript:
 - a form (but without backend yet)
 - a few photo galleries
 - the famous ToDo list
 - I've got acquainted with the .Math functions creating a simple calculator
 - a few simple games, including "Tic-Tac-Toe" and "Sapper"
 - a few projects using the jQuery library (animation and "Memory" game).

 Over time, most of my projects will appear in my repositories  :blush:

#### In the near future, I would like to work as a Junior Frontend Developer, develop my skills in this great technology, set the bar higher and higher!
