I've been learning basic programming languages for web development in my spare time for about a year. I can create a website using HTML and CSS, I'm delving into SASS and RWD, I use the BEM methodology, I also know the basics of JavaScript, jQuery and Git. I want to broaden my knowledge of TypeScript, React.js library and other technologies related to the frontend.

 So far, I have made a few simple projects using pure JavaScript (a form, a few photo galleries, the famous ToDo list, I got acquainted with the .Math functions creating a simple calculator, I also wrote a few simple games, including "Tic-tac-toe" and "Sapper"), and a few projects using the jQuery library (animation and "memory" game). Over time, most of my projects will appear in my repositories.

## In the near future, I would like to work as a Junior Frontend Developer, develop my skills in this great technology, set the bar higher and higher!
